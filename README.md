### Title: E-Voting system support for student assembly

This diploma thesis was developed in the context of an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree (M.Eng) from the University of Patras.

Research was carried out regarding the feasibility of the creation of an online and purely decentralized, e-voting system using the university student body assembly as a case study. A custom blockchain protocol was created and a PoC application implementing said protocol was developed.

The blockchain protocol uses a combination of:
 * Customized discrete log based additive homomorphic encryption;
 * Customized non-interactive proof of validity;
 * Secure multi-party computation based on Shamir secret sharing;
 * PKI based digital signatures;
