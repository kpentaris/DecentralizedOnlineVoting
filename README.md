### Project Title: E-Voting system support for student assembly

Research was carried out regarding the feasibility of the creation of an online and purely decentralized, e-voting system using a school student body assembly as a case study. A custom blockchain protocol was created and a PoC application implementing said protocol was developed.

The blockchain protocol uses a combination of:
 * Customized discrete log based additive homomorphic encryption;
 * Customized non-interactive proof of validity;
 * Secure multi-party computation based on Shamir secret sharing;
 * PKI based digital signatures;
